        Hi there! I am James, an aspiring full-stack JavaScript developer. I am currently an undergraduate
        at the University of Portsmouth studying Web Technologies. I am in my 4th and final year, where I am
        currently building a <a target="_blank" href="#">FIFA Esports Statistic-Driven Web Application</a> for my project along
        with other web-related units.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an avid Football and Arsenal fan; I try to attend matches as regularly as possible!
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that learning is as essential as eating. I love to learn new things, whether it be
        keeping up with the latest trends and technologies in the web industry, reading books regularly
        or new fitness programmes, I'm open to anything!
      </p>
